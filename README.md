# Pig Latin Translator
This Pig Latin Translator translates text from English to Pig Latin. This is a project I have been working on to make a completely working Pig Latin Translator API. This is a 1-way translator meaning it doesn't convert Pig Latin back to English and it only converts English to Pig Latin. To learn more about Pig Latin, you can look into this [article](https://www.tomedes.com/translator-hub/pig-latin).

> This Project is still a WIP, but it will be complete soon.
