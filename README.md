# Pig Latin Translator
This Pig Latin Translator translates text from English to Pig Latin. This is a project I have been working on to make a completely working Pig Latin Translator API. This is a 1-way translator meaning it doesn't convert Pig Latin back to English and it only converts English to Pig Latin. To learn more about Pig Latin, you can look into this [article](https://www.tomedes.com/translator-hub/pig-latin).

### USAGE:
As of now, you will just have to copy and paste the code or download it manually to use this in your projects but I am looking to publishing this on something like maven where you can just install it as a dependency rather than having to manually download the code.

### EXTRA:
- [ ] Add the project to maven (if that is a possibility)
